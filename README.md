Yet Another Web-based Touch Typing Exercise

The approach used in this exercise is heavily influenced by http://learn.dvorak.nl . The idea of using normal words instead of arbitrary key sequences is quite helpful. This approach slightly modified in TouchType:
* Use single words at a given time instead of sequence of them. This is mainly to have a more sleek layout and perhaps open the possibility to more game mechanics
* Support more key layouts
* Support more languages
